#Task 1 - perform basic mathematical operation
a = int(input(" Enter the First Number: "))
b = int(input(" Enter the Second Number: "))

#Mathematical operations are as follows
Add = a + b
print("Addition = ",Add)
Sub = a - b
print("Subtraction = ",Sub)
Mul = a * b
print("Multiplication = ",Mul)
Div = a / b
print("Division = ",Div)
