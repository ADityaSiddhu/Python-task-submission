## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

# Overview: 
This program performs the recursion to get the factorial of input number. It takes the input from user and displays the output accordingly.

# Functionality:
  Prompts the user to enter a number.
  Gets into the function defined and then check the if-else condition.
  If condition: the number is less than 2 then it should return 1.
  Else condition: the number is greater than 2 then i should get in a recursion.

# Usage :
1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter the number when prompted.
3. View the results displayed on the screen.

## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

# Overview:
This program imports the math module to perform some mathematical operation on the number entered. It takes the input from user and displays the output accordingly.

# Functionality : 
  Prompts the user to enter a number.
  Using the math functionality that is been imported the following operations are performed:
	1. calculating square root of the entered number
	2. calculating logarithm of the entered number
	3. calculating sine of the entered number

# Usage:
1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter the number when prompted.
3. View the results displayed on the screen.
